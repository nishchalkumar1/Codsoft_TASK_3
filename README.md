__TIC-TAC-TOE GAME__

TIC-TAC-TOE GAME is a simple and classic two players game played on 3x3 grid.
I’ve developed the TIC-TAC-TOE game using c++ programming language .
This project involved implementing input validation, designing a user-friendly interface and ensuring a smooth gameplay.
I’ve coded the win-check function to detect three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
Player interaction: I’ve designed a smooth turn-based system. X and O take turns, and the game announces the winner or a draw. 
Moreover I have introduced players name feature in which players can add their names.
