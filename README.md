# Codsoft_TASK_3
__TIC-TAC-TOE GAME__
I’ve organized the game logic using a 2D array, implemented input validation, and ensured a clean console interface.
I’ve coded the win-check function to detect three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
Player interaction: I’ve designed a smooth turn-based system. X and O take turns, and the game announces the winner or a draw. Moreover I have introduced players name feature in which players can add their names.
